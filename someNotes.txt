An introduction to tetris:
The user to has to navigate 5 shapes or tetromenoes down a grid.
We have to navigate them such that they fill up an entire row and when that happens we gain points.
The user has the ability to rotate the shapes and the user also made aware of which shape is up next.

In the tutorial the instructor decides to make a 20*10 grid for the game, thus the 200 divs.

forEach() function:
The forEach function call a provided call-back function ONCE for EACH item in an ARRAY in ASCENDING order.
The call-back is invoked using three arguments 1.The value of the element 2.The index of the element 3.The array object that is being traversed. (.forEach(value, index, object);)
Note: I think the instructor meant either of the 3 needs to be used. Cuz in the example we use the arrow function for the argument.

forEach example:
let names = ['Ishan', 'Mob', 'Shiro-T poison']
names.forEach(name =>{
    console.log(name + ' is the best')
})

setInterval() function:
It calls the specified function after every x amount of time.
setInterval(function, 1000) //1000 miliseconds
