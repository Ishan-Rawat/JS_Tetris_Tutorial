An introduction to tetris:
The user to has to navigate 5 shapes or tetromenoes down a grid.
We have to navigate them such that they fill up an entire row and when that happens we gain points.
The user has the ability to rotate the shapes and the user also made aware of which shape is up next.

In the tutorial the instructor decides to make a 20*10 grid for the game, thus the 200 divs.

forEach() function:
The forEach function call a provided call-back function ONCE for EACH item in an ARRAY in ASCENDING order.
The call-back is invoked using three arguments 1.The value of the element 2.The index of the element 3.The array object that is being traversed. (.forEach(value, index, object);)
Note: I think the instructor meant either of the 3 needs to be used. Cuz in the example we use the arrow function for the argument.

forEach example:
let names = ['Ishan', 'Mob', 'Shiro-T poison']
names.forEach(name =>{
    console.log(name + ' is the best')
})

setInterval() function:
It calls the specified function after every x amount of time.
setInterval(function, 1000) //1000 miliseconds

divs with class = "taken":
last ten divs have the class "taken", they will be used to stop the tetromino from falling down the bottom of the grid

some() function:
it is an in-built function that returns true if atleast one of the items in an array meets the condition specified. 
It runs for all the items in the array.

How we intend to stop our shapes from going off bounds from the left side:
we know that our grid 10 squares wide. So all the left edge blocks are numbered 10, 20, 30, and so on.
If our shape is touching a block that is numbered a multiple of 10 we won't allow it to move further left.

KeyCodes and Events:
Every key on our keyboard has a keycode assigned to it that we can access through our JavaScript. We can find out the keycode for any key on 
a cool site: keycode.info

.addEventListener('event', function) function:
This function calls a specified function as soon as some specified event occurs.
This function can be attached to an element of the html code such as a div to make things happen.
In our code we attach this eventListner to the whole HTML document.
Also, for the 'event' arg, there are some specific args to be used there, not something that we create (apparently), gotta chack the docs or something.
We also have a removeEventListener() function. Not discussed here tho.

Displaying the next tetromino:
We will create a 4*4  grid next to the main grid.
we do so by creating a new div with class: and we create 16 divs inside it. 
Then we put all divs of the main grid and the mini-grid inside another grid so that we can use flexbox to make them appear next to each other.
